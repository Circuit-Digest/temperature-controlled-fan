In today's fast-paced world, convenience is key. Dealing with the temperature fluctuations in your living space can be quite a hassle. For those who live in regions where the afternoons can be sweltering hot and the nights chillingly cold, constantly adjusting your wall fan can be annoying. However, with a little bit of DIY ingenuity and the help of some electronic components, you can transform your ordinary electric fan into an automatic one. In this blog, we'll guide you through the process of converting your Temperature Controlled Fan using an Arduino, LM35 temperature sensor, and a relay.

Summary of Temperature controlled fan project
We will be making the project stepwise. We will first interface the LM35 sensor with Arduino to measure the surrounding temperature and relay to control the fan. We will then upload the conditional code in Arduino and check the output.
